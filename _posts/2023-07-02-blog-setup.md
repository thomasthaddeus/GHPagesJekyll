## Beginning

Maybe I'll do it here, or elsewhere. Haven't decided yet, but I'm going to start a blog because I was asked too.

I'll be talking about CTF's and other nonsense. Whatever comes to mind as I'm writing I suppose. I promise if nothing else it will be about this level of rambling and occassionally an even larger amount of nonsenical ramblings!

For now I'm going to make a todo list to get this up and running.

- [x] Change directory
- [x] Add posts
- [x] update `_config.yml`
- [x] update `index.md`
- [x] move these files to one repo
- [x] Come up with subjects
- [x] set schedule for posting
- [x] post the blog to an indiscrete location
- [x] Name the Blog
