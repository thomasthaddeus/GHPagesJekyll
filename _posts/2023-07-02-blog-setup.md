## Beginning

Maybe I'll do it here, or elsewhere. Haven't decided yet, but I'm going to start a blog because I was asked too.

I'll be talking about CTF's and other nonsense. Whatever comes to mind as I'm writing I suppose. I promise if nothing else it will be about this level of rambling and occassionally an even larger amount of nonsenical ramblings!

For now I'm going to make a todo list to get this up and running.

- [ ] Change directory
- [x] Add posts
- [ ] update `_config.yml`
- [ ] update `index.md`
- [ ] move these files to one repo
- [ ] Come up with subjects
- [ ] set schedule for posting
- [ ] post the blog to a indiscrete location
- [ ] Name the Blog
